       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
           <li>150g rindless unsmoked fatty pancetta or guanciale, finely chopped</li>
           <li>1 garlic clove, bashed</li>
           <li>200g spaghetti or fettuccine</li>
           <li>4 good quality egg yolks, (2 of them are optional)</li>
           <li>50g parmesan, finely grated</li>
           <li>a few drops of truffle oil (optional)</li>
       </ol>

       <h3>Method</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>step 1
             <p>First, warm your serving dishes in a low oven or in the microwave. <br>
                 Heat the oil gently in a large, shallow pan. Fry the guanciale or <br>
                  pancetta and garlic for 10 mins, or until all the fat has rendered <br>
                   off and the meat is golden and crisp. Remove and discard the garlic clove, <br>
                    then turn off the heat.</p>
         </li>
         <li>step 2
             <p>Bring a large pan of salted water to a simmer and cook the pasta until it’s <br>
                 al dente (about a minute less than the pack instructions). Meanwhile, whisk 2 <br>
                  egg yolks in a small bowl with a pinch of salt.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>step 3
             <p>Using kitchen tongs, lift the pasta from the water into the pancetta pan along with <br>
                 any dripping water. Use a wooden spoon to stir it into the rendered fat. If the pan <br>
                  looks dry, add a small ladleful of pasta water and mix it in. Keep adding until you <br>
                   see a little pasta water at the bottom of the pan – you’ll be surprised how much will <br>
                    be absorbed.</p>
         </li>
         <li>step 4
             <p>Working quickly, tip the beaten yolks in with the pasta and stir vigorously. Rinse the yolk <br>
                 bowl out with a little more pasta water and pour that in too. Add most of the parmesan and beat <br>
                  again. If at any time it’s becoming claggy or starting to scramble, pour in a little more water. <br>
                   If you’ve added too much, stir the pasta over the lowest heat for a few moments. You’re aiming for a <br>
                    smooth sauce that is the consistency of double cream. Season with a couple of pinches of ground black pepper <br>
                     and taste for salt.</p>
         </li>
         <li>step 5
             <p>Transfer the pasta to the warmed serving dishes, scatter over the remaining parmesan and nestle <br>
                 the last two egg yolks on top, if using. Season them with some salt and pepper, and drizzle over <br>
                  the truffle oil, if you have it, just before serving.</p>
         </li>
       </ul>
