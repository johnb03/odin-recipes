       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <h4>For the base</h4>
       <ol>
           <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
           <li>1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)</li>
           <li>1 tsp salt</li>
           <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
       </ol>
       
       <h4>For the tomato sauce</h4>
       <ol>
           <li>100ml passata</li>
           <li>handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried<li>
              1 garlic clove, crushed
       
       </ol>
       <h4>For the topping</h4>
       <ol>
           <li>125g ball mozzarella, sliced </li>
           <li>handful grated or shaved parmesan (or vegetarian alternative)<li>
            handful of cherry tomatoes, halved
       </ol>

       <h3>Method</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>step 1
           <p>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, <br>
             then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in <br>
              200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with <br>
               a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto <br>
                a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with <br>
                 a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but <br>
                  it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p>
         </li>
         <li>step 2
           <p>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season <br>
             to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p>
         </li>
         <li>step 3
           <p>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split <br>
             into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, <br>
              using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds <br>
               onto two floured baking sheets.</p>
         </li>
         <li>step 4
           <p>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray <br>
             in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes,<br>
              drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. <br>
               Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining <br> pizza.</p>

         </li>
       </ul>
